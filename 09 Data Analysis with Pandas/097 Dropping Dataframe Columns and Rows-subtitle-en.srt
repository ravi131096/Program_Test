1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,850
Alright now you know how to extract portion of a data frame.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,040
But how about deleting columns or rows from a data frame.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:16,650
Well for that you do want to use the df7.drop. So the Drop Method.

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,690
Note that this is also not an inplace operation.

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,340
So your df7 data frame will not be updated

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:31,230
with the deleted column. And yeah, let me delete the City column. You'd pass city for the column name and then 1.

7
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:38,460
So the 1 argument means that you are about to delete columns. That's how you tell Pandas or Python

8
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,470
what you're about to delete. When you delete throws you want to pass zero.

9
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,810
So yeah this is the on the fly data frame without the city column there.

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:57,440
So again df7 with City and drop.

11
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:08,350
Let me drop 332 Hill St zero. And yeah, Hill Street is not there.

12
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:18,240
And of course if you want to update your data frame with the changes you do that and then when you print out

13
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,970
your df7 data frame the Hill Street is not there.

14
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:32,490
Yeah if you want to drop columns or rows based on indexing you do a trick like df7 and then points

15
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,930
to index.

16
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,010
And than what do you want.

17
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,120
Well zero to three maybe.

18
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:44,440
So you are deleting rows. Execute that and you get the 3 rows only.

19
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:52,500
Similarly with columns. Columns and one in here.

20
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,390
So you get ID name and state.

21
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,970
The first three columns.

22
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:05,190
So if that confused you know df7.index what that gives you is a series with the names

23
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,690
or with the labels of your index column.

24
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:15,610
So all of these and similarly Columns gives you the names all of your columns.

25
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,830
So that's how you access the header of your data frame and the index column.

26
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,970
And yeah, that was about deleting columns and rows from the data frame.

27
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,800
If you have questions just feel free to ask them.

28
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,200
I'll talk to you to the next lecture.
