1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,840
Well in this lecture I'll show you how to set up the Jupiter Notebook or Jupiter for short and also

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,070
how to use it.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,240
So far you've worked both with Python and an iPython interactive shell but also you work with

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,380
an editor such as Atom.

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:27,870
Sometimes you may have the need for a hybrid between an interactive shell and an editor. When you

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:35,160
want to test things out but you also want to just save your blocks of code that you were writing because

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,880
an interactive shell is great for testing things quickly.

8
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:45,930
But you cant save the code and the editor is good for saving the code but it's not great for testing

9
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:46,990
things.

10
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:54,330
But I can tell you were that such a hybrid tool is that it's called Jupiter Notebook and that is an

11
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,430
amazing tool that will boost your productivity.

12
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:04,110
And Jupiter is especially good when you're working with data as it's a great environment to explore

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,190
data and you'll see its usefulness in just a bit.

14
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,130
Of course you still want to use editor such as Atom when you're working with multiple Python scripts

15
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:20,450
that interact with each other. That's the case of a web application

16
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,080
for example when you're developing web applications.

17
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,650
You'll have to deal with multiple Python scripts and also HTML files CSS and other files

18
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,870
as well.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,130
We well build a web application later of course and you'll see how Atom is good for that.

20
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,490
But for data use Jupiter.

21
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,640
So Jupiter, let's see how to install it.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,530
Well we can go to the instalation so install and you can go through these instructions.

23
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,880
But instead of going for this advice you actually to use your command line to install Jupiter.

24
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,720
Typing pip install Jupiter.

25
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:12,490
So that will download Jupiter and it will install it in your system. And then to start a Jupiter session

26
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,100
a good practice is to go to a folder.

27
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:30,250
Let's say test 3 and here you can open a command prompt and then you type Jupiter Notebook

28
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,830
That will open

29
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:39,670
a Jupiter session in the browser. So the Jupiter an old book is actually a browser notebook.

30
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:46,110
The reason I opened the Jupiter notebook in the command line was that at least we know so when you do

31
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,750
shift and then right click on the folder your command prompt is opened in the current folder.

32
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,880
So in this one here.

33
00:02:53,310 --> 00:03:00,470
And then when you create a notebook file now every file will be saved in this directory here.

34
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:08,180
Alternatively you can open your command prompt everywhere you want and then you can CD to the folder where

35
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,250
you want to save your Jupiter Notebooks.

36
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:11,640
All right.

37
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,290
Now we don't have anything here.

38
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:23,070
So what you can do is create a notebook and we installed Jupiter as Python Library so under notebooks

39
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,360
we have Python 3 available.

40
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:33,430
So the kernel with the Python 3 if you have associated all the languages here you'll see them under

41
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,780
here on their notebooks.

42
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,150
So this is an empty notebook.

43
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:46,460
This is the name of a notebook and you can change it to let's say testing.

44
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,660
Press Ok.

45
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:57,240
And if you go to the folder you'll see that a file with testing name and iPython notebook extension

46
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:03,450
was created so that it's created automatically every time you type something you do some changes or

47
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,380
something.

48
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:11,370
Now let me show you how you can work with the iPython Notebook so you can consider every cell of This cell

49
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,720
and you can consider every cell as a line in you know normal Python shell.

50
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:23,980
But here in this trial you can actually write multiple lines of code let's say print 1 and then

51
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,640
if you don't want to execute this right away you can press enter.

52
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:33,270
So we enter you enter a new line in the cell and then print 2 and so on.

53
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:41,330
And if you want to execute the cell now you can't press Control Enter and you get the output.

54
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:46,630
Now if you want to create a new cell ALT enter it would do that.

55
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,640
And here you can write another block of code.

56
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,310
With Enter you go to the next line and so on.

57
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:00,150
And if you want to go to the next cell right away.

58
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:06,410
So before we pressed Control Enter now you can press Shift Enter and you go to the next cell automatically.

59
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,030
With Shift Enter

60
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,710
you also execute the cell what are you working on.

61
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:17,310
You're going create new cells with ALT Enter and you can deal with them by pressing first you press

62
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:23,420
Escape and then you press dd 2 times dd again.

63
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,220
So it's quite flexible.

64
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,890
Something you shouldn't notice is that we have two modes.

65
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,650
Basically we have the command mode.

66
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:39,570
So when you are in the common mode you see a gray rectangle around the cell and when you are to go to

67
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,820
the edit more then you press Enter.

68
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:47,560
So while you are focused on the current cell you press Eneter and then you edit the cell.

69
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,100
So in edit mode when you type things you're inserting text in the cell.

70
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:59,140
Youre inserting code is in the cell. Escape and common mode.

71
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:06,180
Dd and you delete the cell. ALT Enter and you enter a new cell.

72
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:10,380
So these are the most used short cuts, keyboard shortcuts.

73
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:17,100
But if you want to know more shortcuts you can go to Help and then Keyboard Shortcuts and then you see

74
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,880
a list here.

75
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,220
But these are good to get started.

76
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:29,220
When you're done with this you can just close the tab and you can also close the directory tree here

77
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,490
.

78
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,720
So notice that Jupiter actually opens in a local host session.

79
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:43,320
And if you want to open again your notebook you can go here again and go to Open Command Window

80
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:49,180
here and Jupiter Notebook.

81
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:56,270
And here is the file and it's just as we left it.

82
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:02,950
Now a Jupiter notebook is best used for doing explorations and especially data explorations.

83
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:09,540
So if you're working with data analysis or data visualizations the Jupiter Notebook

84
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,440
is perfect to use.

85
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:18,480
You can use the Jupiter Notebook for example to load a table of data in the session.

86
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,420
And for that you'd use Pandas.

87
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:27,930
So you import the library, you press Enter or Shift Enter to go to the next cell and you press Enter

88
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,720
again to write something.

89
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:33,830
So let's say df equals to Pandas.readcsv.

90
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:47,100
And I have a CSV file somewhere in my system.

91
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,770
Press Enter and Wow.

92
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:59,160
So you get a nice HTML table which was loaded from the CSV file and you can also plot graphs in the Jupiter

93
00:07:59,300 --> 00:07:59,960
Notebook.

94
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,130
So that's also something you're learning in the course.

95
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,360
So data analysis and visualizations.

96
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,840
You can also use the Jupiter Notebook for web scrapping and that is very convenient because you

97
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:20,310
have these blocks of code and then the you have to continuously tweak the code so you may want to change

98
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,550
something here and then you get a nice display.

99
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:31,020
Not this one exactly because this is a messed up stream but this one for instance you have a slider

100
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:40,260
here so you can scroll up and down you know inside a separate window that doesn't affect you or general

101
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,760
your main window.

102
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:48,540
So I hope you have gotten a good idea of the Jupiter Notebook. Just take a note of the shortcuts

103
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,120
all the keyboard shortcuts to execute

104
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,790
code the edits and the command mode you know. Enter Escape and Enter again and so on and so forth.

105
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,390
And you just practice them a little bit.

106
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,620
You'll get used with Jupiter

107
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,670
very quickly. See where the next lecture.
