00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:09,260
Hey welcome to this new section and in this section you'll learn how to use Pandas which is a very important

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,880
Python library and you really don't want to miss that.

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,830
So what is Pandas?

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:23,690
Well Pandas is a library providing data structures and data analysis tools within Python

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:29,760
Or if the word tools confuses you then you can say Pandas is a library providing data structures and data

6
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,420
analysis code.

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:38,880
So basically Pandas allows you to load data from different sources into Python and than use Python code

8
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:47,120
to analyze those data and produce results which can be in the form of tables, text and also visualization

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,370
.

10
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:55,320
With the help of visualization and libraries such as Bokeh which is covered later in of course

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:55,840
.

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,400
So for now we'll focus on data without visualizing them and Pandas is great for that.

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:10,170
So practically how do we use Pandas? Well, you learnt how to open text files using Python built in

14
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,050
file handling methods earlier in the course.

15
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,820
Now what we opened from text files was just plain text.

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,450
But what if you want to load text files with data constructed of rows and columns?

17
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,750
So things get a bit complicated but here is where Pandas comes into play.

18
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:34,620
So you can probably do that using built in Python methods that we have learned in the course but to

19
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:41,880
be more efficient and to be much more efficient you need to have a high level library such as Pandas which

20
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,820
is able to recognize such a data structure so automatically.

21
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:53,550
So I use Pandas for loading data from data mining activities such as web scrapping so you scrap

22
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:59,190
data from a website with Python and then store those data are in Pandas data frames.

23
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:05,760
So you use Pandas to provide data structures for you in Python. And I use Pandas for loading data from

24
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,570
Excel files and also use Pandas for analyzing those data instead of using Excel.

25
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:17,160
Excel can be good for analyzing a small table of data that that fits in your screen, in your computer

26
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,660
screen but for data larger than that

27
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,430
you really want to use code.

28
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:31,110
So you write Python code once and you reuse it with other data as well and you don't want to do

29
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:38,100
selections and dragging and many other cumbersome operations that you normally do in a graphical

30
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,530
based program such as Excel.

31
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,510
So code is the way to go if you want to be efficient with data.

32
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,230
And Python is great for that

33
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:55,320
with Pandas. So you really want to get a good hang of Pandas and you will learn that in this section and

34
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:01,740
also practice it with real world applications that we will be building as you progress through the course

35
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,810
.

36
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,440
Now that's enough with words.

37
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:12,090
Let's go ahead and install Pandas. You want to open the terminal and the process is straightforward.

38
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,370
You say: Pip install Pandas.

39
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:23,430
Now I mentioned that Pandas is a high level library and Pandas is based on Numpy which you can see

40
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,710
in here.

41
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:33,240
So Pandas is now trying to install Numpy because without Numpy you cannot use Pandas.

42
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:40,030
Numpy is a more low level library than Pandas. We will cover Numpy later on.

43
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,970
But I wanted you to know Pandas first because that is more easy to understand.

44
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:52,140
So once you know how to use Pandas, then you think about Numpy and Ill show you how Numpy is the base of

45
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:52,880
Pandas.

46
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,710
So let's not think about Numpy now.

47
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,200
Yeah, so this was successful.

48
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:04,320
But if for any reason it wasn't successful on your side and I know that in some windows distributions

49
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:11,970
you may get an error such as this one here. So it says: Unable to find this bat file.

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:21,540
And that happens to be because Pandas is trying to compile itself but it cannot find a compiler

51
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:21,900
.

52
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:31,230
So in that case the easiest solution that you can do is to use precompiled Python libraries which you can

53
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,130
find in this case in this website.

54
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,050
So they're provided by Chris Gholke.

55
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,880
Now you want to locate Numpy first.

56
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:50,130
So here is Numpy. You click that and that goes down here and then you want to pick up your version

57
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:50,330
.

58
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:59,220
So if you have Python 3.5 youd want to go for this cp35 and then you have 32 bits of windows and 64

59
00:04:59,220 --> 00:04:59,790
.

60
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,920
So you want to pick your own bits.

61
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:10,020
So what you do is you download that that is whl file which is the same file that you install

62
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:17,340
with Pip but with Pip you download it and then you install it. In this case the download is being done manually

63
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,430
and then we point to this file with Pip again to install.

64
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,970
Ill show how to do that.

65
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:30,450
And once that file is downloaded successfully Ive put in here in my C drive C PP and then you want

66
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:44,070
to either CD to that directory and then use Pip install and then start typing in the name of that file.

67
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,690
Tab to get the complete file name.

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,830
Now you should pres enter and that will install Numpy for you.

69
00:05:52,950 --> 00:06:01,540
Once you are done with Numpy, than you go ahead and get Pandas as well. Pandas. These are the distributions

70
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:01,560
.

71
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:08,330
Again you get 3.5 if you have the 3.5 version for Python and the Windows version as well.

72
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,730
And you repeat the same process.

73
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:24,830
I hope that is clear. Once you install Pandas then you can simply go ahead import it.

74
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,760
There is no error and you are good to go.

75
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,170
So that was about an introduction to Pandas and how to install it.

76
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:36,600
Let's go ahead and dive into some code now in the next lectures. See you.
